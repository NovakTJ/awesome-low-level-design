This codebase is a collection of solved low-level design problems and related resources. It includes interview problems categorized by difficulty (Easy, Medium, Hard), along with links to courses, books, newsletters, and additional learning materials to help users improve their low-level design skills.
Users can explore various design problems, study solutions, and utilize the provided resources to prepare for technical interviews and enhance their understanding of low-level design concepts.
The relevant files are in the following folders:
- `problems/`: Contains markdown files for each low-level design problem.
- `solutions/java/src/`: Contains Java solutions for the design problems.

When a users asks a question related to a specifc problem, consider the solution in the `solutions/java/src/` folder that corresponds to that problem, for example `solutions/java/src/chessgame` for the `chess-game.md` problem. The naming is consistent between the problem files and solution folders, other than the case convention. The problem file uses kebab-case while the solution folder uses flatcase.
